        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have took some college level programming courses and courses from Udemy. These experience helps me understand how things work behind the screen. I am currently enrolled in Lambda School, and I will learn lot more technique from them to build great projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Programming is a skill that requires lots of hours of learning and practicing. I never thought of myself becoming a web developer when I was still just a kid, but I know if there is something that has to do with computer I'd be down!
